# GitHub Releases

The "releases" page on GitHub projects links to a page containing the
project's history, or changelog. Releases are attached to an existing
Git tag, so make sure the [Git part](./git.md) is configured correctly.

Unsurprisingly, release-it uses this feature extensively:
[release-it's releases page](https://github.com/release-it/release-it/releases).

See this screenshot for an overview of what release-it automates:

To add
[GitHub releases](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/)
in your release-it flow:

- Configure `github.release: true`.
- Obtain a
  [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=release-it)
  (release-it only needs "repo" access; no "admin" or other scopes).
- Make sure the token is
  [available as an environment variable](./environment-variables.md).

Do not put the actual token in the release-it configuration. It will be
read from the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. You can change this
variable name by setting the `github.tokenRef` option to something else.

## Git

A GitHub Release requires the corresponding Git tag to be present on the
remote (release-it creates and pushes this tag automatically). Thus, in
addition to the `GITHUB_TOKEN`, a public SSH key is required to push the
Git tag to the remote repository. See
[Git remotes](./git.md#git-remotes) (and [CI: Git](./ci.md#git)) for
more information.

## Prerequisite checks

First, release-it will check whether the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment
variable is set. Otherwise it will throw an error and exit. Then, it
will authenticate, and verify whether the current user is a collaborator
and authorized to publish a release.

To skip these checks, use `github.skipChecks`.

## Release name

The default release name is `Release ${version}`. However, many projects
are more creative here. It can be set from the command-line directly:
`--github.releaseName="Arcade Silver"`.

## Release notes

By default, the output of `git.changelog` is used for the GitHub release
notes. This is the printed `Changelog: ...` when release-it boots. This
can be overridden with the `github.releaseNotes` option to customize the
release notes for the GitHub release. This script will run just before
the actual GitHub release itself. Make sure it outputs to `stdout`. An
example:

```json
{
	"github": {
		"release": true,
		"releaseNotes": "generate-release-notes.sh ${latestVersion} ${version}"
	}
}
```

See [Changelog](./changelog.md) for more information about generating
changelogs/release notes.

## Attach binary assets

To upload binary release assets with a GitHub release (such as compiled
executables, minified scripts, documentation), provide one or more glob
patterns for the `github.assets` option. After the release, the assets
are available to download from the GitHub release page. Example:

```json
{
	"github": {
		"release": true,
		"assets": ["dist/*.zip"]
	}
}
```

## Pre-release

If the release is a pre-release (according to semver), release-it
automatically sets `github.preRelease` to `true`. This can also be set
manually.

## Draft

In case the release should not be made public yet, set
`github.draft: true`.

## Host

Use a different host from what would be derived from the Git url (e.g.
when using GitHub Enterprise).

## Proxy

In case release are done from behind a proxy, set `github.proxy` using a
string to a proxy address like `"http://proxy:8080"`.

## Update the latest release

The latest GitHub release can be updated, e.g. to update the releases
notes, add release assets, or toggle the `draft` status.

- Use `--no-increment` to skip updating the version.
- Use `--no-git` to skip Git actions.
- Use `--no-npm` to skip publishing to npm if there's a `package.json`.

Use the other options to update the release, such as `--github.assets`
to add assets. Note that the `draft` and `preRelease` options are
`false` by default, but can be set explicitly using e.g.
`--no-github.draft` or `--github.draft`.

Example command to add assets and explicitly toggle the draft status to
"published":

```bash
release-it --no-increment --no-git --github.release --github.assets=*.zip --no-github.draft
```
